If I had more time I would:
add robust error messages on backend/server-side
add more ui validation - like preventing user from creating an app with the same name
remove forceupdates and replace them with something more robust and efficient 

I'd like to explore more what an app looks like here
What does the data model look like?


create a deployment script to Heroku, AWS or Google Cloud

Better handle redirects

Make form validators more robust

Reuse components more
Multiple delete on front page
verbose error messages
